# Snake-game
The popular snake game recreated in C++
This is a game and is therefore for purely recreational purposes only.
The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets longer as it moves.  
In another common scheme, the snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head. 

INPUTS- Left, Right, Up, Down keys on keyboard

ERROR HANDLING- The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, a trail or other obstacle, or itself.

OUTPUTS- 
The snake moves on the screen based on which arrow key the user presses. As the snake consumes more food, its tail keeps on growing.
